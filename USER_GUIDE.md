## 🎓 Understanding the Boilerplates

### What Is a Boilerplate?

**Simple Definition**: Pre-written, tested code you can copy into your project

**Why Use Them?**
- ✅ **Save Time**: Don't reinvent the wheel
- ✅ **Best Practices**: Learn from production code
- ✅ **Consistency**: Same patterns across projects
- ✅ **Quality**: Tested and debugged

### How Are They Organized?

Each boilerplate follows this structure:

```
boilerplate-name/
├── README.md              # Documentation

│   ├── ComponentName.tsx
│   └── ...
├── lib/                   # Utilities & services
│   ├── service.ts
│   └── utils.ts
├── database/              # SQL schemas
│   ├── schema.sql
│   └── rls-policies.sql
├── types/                 # TypeScript types
│   └── index.ts
└── examples/              # Usage examples
    └── example.tsx
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start Small
**Don't add all 42 boilerplates at once**

Start with:
1. Authentication
2. One core feature (e.g., course-management)
3. Basic UI components

Add more as you need them.

### Tip 2: Read the README
**Every boilerplate has a detailed README**

It includes:
- What it does
- How to install
- How to use
- Examples
- Troubleshooting

### Tip 3: Customize Gradually
**Don't modify everything at once**

1. Use as-is first
2. Understand how it works
3. Then customize

### Tip 4: Keep Updated
**Boilerplates improve over time**

```bash
# Check for updates
techshu update

# Update specific boilerplate
techshu update authentication
```

### Tip 5: Contribute Back
**Found a bug? Have an improvement?**

1. Open an issue on GitHub
2. Submit a pull request
3. Help others learn
