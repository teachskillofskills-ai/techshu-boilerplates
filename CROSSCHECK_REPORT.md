## 📋 How to Complete the Boilerplates

### Option 1: Copy Source Files Manually (Recommended)

For each boilerplate that needs source files:

```bash
# Example: AI Chat System
# 1. Find the source files in your codebase
find . -name "*chat*" -type f

# 2. Copy to boilerplate
cp components/chat/AIChatInterface.tsx boilerplates/ai-chat-system/components/
cp lib/chat/chat-service.ts boilerplates/ai-chat-system/lib/

# 3. Repeat for other boilerplates
```

### Option 2: Use Boilerplates with READMEs Only

Even without source files, you can:

1. **Read the README** - Understand what the boilerplate does
2. **Follow the API Reference** - See what functions/components you need
3. **Copy from your codebase** - Use the README as a guide to find and copy the right files
4. **Implement from scratch** - Use the README as a specification

### Option 3: Use as Documentation

The READMEs serve as excellent documentation for:
- Understanding your codebase structure
- Learning how components work
- Planning new features
- Onboarding new developers

## ✅ How to Use Boilerplates in Other Projects

### Method 1: Copy Entire Boilerplate

```bash
# Copy entire boilerplate to new project
cp -r boilerplates/email-service /path/to/new-project/src/lib/email

# Install dependencies (check README)
cd /path/to/new-project
npm install brevo

# Configure environment variables
echo "BREVO_API_KEY=your_key" >> .env.local

# Follow README for setup
```

### Method 2: Copy Specific Files

```bash
# Copy only what you need
cp boilerplates/design-system/lib/tokens.ts /path/to/new-project/src/lib/
cp boilerplates/design-system/lib/themes.ts /path/to/new-project/src/lib/

# Adjust imports as needed
```

### Method 3: Use as Reference

```bash
# Keep boilerplates as reference
# Read README to understand implementation
# Implement similar functionality in your project
```

## 📖 Using Boilerplates in Different Project Types

### Next.js 14 (App Router) - Direct Copy

```bash
# These boilerplates work directly in Next.js 14 App Router
cp -r boilerplates/authentication /path/to/nextjs-project/src/lib/
cp -r boilerplates/email-service /path/to/nextjs-project/src/lib/
```

### Next.js 13 (Pages Router) - Minor Adjustments

```bash
# Copy files
cp -r boilerplates/user-management /path/to/nextjs-project/src/

# Adjust:
# - Change app/ to pages/
# - Update imports
# - Adjust API routes
```

### React (Vite/CRA) - Adjust Server Components

```bash
# Copy client components
cp -r boilerplates/dashboard-components/components /path/to/react-project/src/

# Skip server-side code
# Adjust:
# - Remove 'use server' directives
# - Replace server actions with API calls
# - Use fetch/axios for data fetching
```

### Other Frameworks (Vue, Svelte, Angular)

```bash
# Use as reference/specification
# Read README to understand:
# - Component structure
# - API requirements
# - Database schema
# - Business logic

# Implement in your framework
```

## 🔧 Adaptation Guide

### For Different Databases

If not using Supabase:

1. **Read database schemas** in `database/` folders
2. **Adapt to your database** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
3. **Update queries** in source files
4. **Keep business logic** the same

### For Different Auth Systems

If not using Supabase Auth:

1. **Read auth logic** in authentication boilerplate
2. **Replace with your auth** (NextAuth, Auth0, Clerk)
3. **Keep permission logic** the same
4. **Update middleware** accordingly

### For Different Styling

If not using Tailwind CSS:

1. **Keep component structure**
2. **Replace Tailwind classes** with your CSS
3. **Maintain responsive design**
4. **Keep accessibility features**
